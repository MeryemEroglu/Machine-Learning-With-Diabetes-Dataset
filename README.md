# Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting whether individuals have diabetes based on certain features. The dataset used in this project is a part of the larger dataset maintained at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as 'outcome,' where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result, and 0 indicates a negative result. The features include:

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Glucose level
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure (Diastolic)
- SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
- Insulin: Insulin level
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Probability of having diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age (years)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves preprocessing and transforming the features to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Models

The project explores several machine learning algorithms for classification tasks:

- Decision Tree Classification (CART)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
3. Base Models
4. Automated Hyperparameter Optimization
5. Stacking & Ensemble Learning
6. Prediction for a New Observation
7. Pipeline Main Function

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.
